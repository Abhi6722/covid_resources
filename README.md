<h2 align="left"> Solution </h2>  
Our main objective it to promote social distancing and also to dismiss any misconceptions that people have developed over the new vaccine which has developed by India. We have analysed a few papers and have found that many people are not willing to take the vaccine. Through our game we want to promote the use of sanitizers , social distancing and preach the importance of vaccination.


<h2 align="left"> INTRODUCTION TO GAME </h2>  

<li>The main character has to avoid all the obstacles present in each level and has to jump on the floating islands  avoiding  the monsters and the viruses. Here the monster represent the more virulent and  deadly  covid strain and the virus the less virulent strain by doing so we have stressed on the different strains which have been found we could not add a few features due to the lack of time however in future we can incorporate all the possible strains .</li>
<li>We have also incorporated vaccine as a weapon as vaccination is the only way we can free our society of this pandemic. We have also kept the gameplay experience easy to understand so that even a kid who is only 5 years old can easily play corona convicts.</li>
<li>The main character has to collect vaccine and inject it to the monster to destroy it and in this process he also has to avoid the virus . If he comes in contact with the virus it would cause him to lose life in the game. If he collects vaccine he would gain life . In this game the user is provided with 5 lives and if he exhausts all of them he will lose the game. He has to collect the vaccine and avoid virus keeping at least one life intact in order to win.</li>

<h2 align="left"> ABOUT THE PLATFORM </h2>  
<li>We have developed our game with Construct 3 software. Construct 3 basically a game making software with the help of which we can create 2D games. <br></li>
<li>Our main point of choosing Construct 3 is that it a browser based software and therefore we don't need a high end PC/laptop. And the team collaboration is also amazing. <br></li>
<li>With construct 3 we can access our game from anywhere and on any device. This also supports offline editing which means we don't even need internet connection all the time for making game. <br></li>
<li>One another and most important feature is that it includes multi platform deployment option. Which means we can export our game for Android, iphone, Windows, Mac and even for xbox, Facebook instant game and HTML5 games. <br></li>
